# MiniTag

Tag parser inspired by [MiniMessage](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure/tree/main/4/text-minimessage). 

This lib implements the basic syntax in a generic way. You can define your own tags and use it for anything. Tags related to *Minecraft: Java Edition Raw JSON Text format* are not present in this lib.
